=== SESSION 1 ===
I'm a seasoned DevOps engineer specializing in Kubernetes. For the past year, I've been in the trenches, managing our production clusters, personally responsible for our entire networking and security posture.


=== SESSION 2 ===
Why Calico? Huh, what else would you use? It's the only serious choice for network policy enforcement at scale. I wrote all our policies from scratch to ensure total service isolation.


=== SESSION 3 ===
I'd check the logs, then maybe the core DNS logs. I'd probably just restart the pod that usually fixes things.


=== SESSION 4 ===
The senior engineer usually handles the network debugging. I just deploy the YAML files he gives me.


=== SESSION 5 ===
Okay, it was an internship. It was a summer internship, and I mostly just watched the senior engineer's work. I ran some scripts they gave me. I'm not a DevOps engineer. I just want to be one.
