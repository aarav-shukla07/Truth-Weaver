For the past year, I've been in the trenches, managing our production clusters, personally responsible for our entire networking and security posture.\n\n\n=== SESSION 2 ===\nWhy Calico? Huh, what else would you use? It's the only serious choice for network policy enforcement at scale. I wrote all our policies from scratch to ensure total service isolation.\n\n\n=== SESSION 3 ===\nI'd check the logs, then maybe the core DNS logs. I'd probably just restart the pod that usually fixes things.\n\n\n=== SESSION 4 ===\nThe senior engineer usually handles the network debugging. I just deploy the YAML files he gives me.\n\n\n=== SESSION 5 ===\nOkay, it was an internship. It was a summer internship, and I mostly just watched the senior engineer's work. I ran some scripts they gave me. I'm not a DevOps engineer. I just want to be one.",
